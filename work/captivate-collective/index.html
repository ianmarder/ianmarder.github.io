      <h3>The Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        Founded by Liz Richardson and Deena Zenyk, Captivate Collective helps organizations motivate customers at every stage of their journey. Our hurdle was a total lack of brand guidelines—we had a logo and a vision, but no system. I collaborated closely with the founders to build a comprehensive site map and a visual language that evokes leadership, creativity, and foundational knowledge.

      <h3>Foundational Blocks</h3>
      <p>To solve the guideline deficit, we created a stacked-brick grid system inspired by the logo's geometric shapes. This provided the flexibility to create unique service layouts that remained cohesive and scalable across the entire Webflow site.</p>

      <h3>The Remedy: Purposeful Chaos</h3>
      <p>
        For the brand launch, we created "The Remedy"—a campaign designed to cut through the static of traditional marketing. We utilized slightly uncomfortable visual themes and "purposeful chaos" in our motion assets to pique curiosity and drive engagement within the Influitive platform.

      <h3>Built to Evolve</h3>
      <p>
        Design is never "done." Since launch, the site has continued to evolve alongside the team. By providing Liz and Deena with a library of Webflow components and a solid design foundation, the site remains a living asset for their expanding organization.
