      Hello there, I’m Ian Marder. I’m driven by the pursuit of purposeful design and the joy of helping people create things.

          I’ve been obsessed with design my whole life. While art is impactful and connecting, design takes those elements and gives them a mission. Discovering how to add purpose to a pirated copy of Photoshop 7 at a young age changed everything for me.

          I love photography, playing drums badly, and anything satirical. If I really had the choice, I’d just follow my kids around with my <span class="word-trigger">Lumix GH5<span class="hover-box"><img src="/assets/images/lumix.png" alt="Keyboard collection"></span></span>.

          I do this instead because I genuinely love the process. I love asking weird questions and finding weirder answers. It’s about more than just aesthetics; it’s about solving problems with intent.

          I appreciate you taking the time to learn a little about me. Feel free to reach out anytime.
